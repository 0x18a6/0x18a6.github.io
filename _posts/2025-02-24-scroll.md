I don't want to scroll.

Scrolling feels evil at this point, it's yet another addiction. Any platform that monetizes on making one scroll is evil as I'm pretty sure the average scrollooor would experience withdrawal symptoms if they were to stop scrolling for few hours.

I'm more self aware of my fingers scrolling, like wtf are they doing?

I've recently read (while scrolling) about [Hu Lezhi](https://etherscan.io/idm?addresses=0x1a19c370ea73d67a0a91085811a1e89e89b36813,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000&type=1). My first intuition was to reference his X account, but fuck it, X makes one scroll, Etherscan life sucking UI doesn't. Anyway, I read about him burning a shitload of ETH to bring attention to his messages on Etherscan:

Now by a shitload of ETH, I mean more than 600 ETH. The message have weight. It's uncanny, as uncanny as BCIs. If an adult is made to do something against their will, to scroll, to click, to buy and sell, what makes you think that Hu Lezhi is not right?

 هل الإنسان مخير أم مسير؟

Hu Lezhi doesn't help answer this question, but adds another perspective that makes it harder. Or maybe I'm just ignorant. Please reach out if you have an answer.

I don't want to scroll. I'll leave it here and push it to my blog to remind myself to not scroll.
